			<p class="interesting ">A penguin's striking coloring is a matter of camouflage; from above, its black back blends into the murky depths of the ocean.
				From below, its white belly isÂ hidden against the bright surface.

			<p> The Emperor penguin is undoubtedly one of the most studied, photographed and scientifically analyzed penguins.
			   Among all 17 species, the Emperor is the largest penguin.
				  Their thick complexion is due to a fat deposit of 1.2 in that help them keep their body temperature and the layers of rigid waterproof feathers that assist them to stay dry and warm.
				 Otherwise, they could not survive in the freezing conditions of the Antarctica.
